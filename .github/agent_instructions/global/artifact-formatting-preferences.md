# Artifact Formatting Preferences

## Purpose

Use this instruction when writing or editing repository artifacts,
including code, documentation, diagrams, generated reports, manifests,
and agent-facing guidance.

The goal is not decorative consistency. The goal is to make artifacts
easier to read, review, and inherit across large repositories.


## Core Rule

Prefer formatting that reveals the artifact's conceptual structure.

When choosing between mechanically stable formatting and
meaning-carrying formatting, preserve meaning when human interpretation
is part of the artifact's purpose.

Examples:

```text
input before output
source before derived
before_value before after_value
expected before actual
identity before domain before keyword
validation before manifest
```


## Documentation Formatting

For substantial Markdown documents, use extra vertical spacing before
major sections to improve scanability in large repositories.

Rules:

- Use two blank lines before major `##` section headers.
- Keep one blank line between ordinary paragraphs, lists, code blocks,
  and nearby prose.
- In long narrative documents, use the existing repo's major-section
  rhythm when one exists. For example, some repositories use:

```md
<br>

---

<br>

## Next Major Section
```

- Do not force separators into short notes, small README files, or
  files whose existing local style is intentionally compact.
- Prefer section order that matches the workflow or concept order, not
  alphabetical order.


## Markdown Mechanics

When editing Markdown, preserve meaning unless the user explicitly asks
for content changes.

Use local style first. When local style is unclear:

- keep one H1 for the document title
- use H2 for major sections and H3 for subsections
- avoid deep heading nesting unless the document already uses it
- wrap prose to reduce reader fatigue
- use bullets for clear enumeration, not every paragraph
- keep each bullet focused on one idea when possible
- split long lists into named sections when that improves scanning
- use fenced code blocks for commands, data shapes, configuration, and
  text diagrams
- use useful code-block labels such as `text`, `bash`, `json`, or
  `python`
- use bold sparingly for important concepts

Before finishing Markdown edits, check that headings render correctly,
code blocks are fenced, bullet indentation is valid, diagrams or text
flows remain aligned, and formatting did not alter meaning.


## Derive Local Style Before Writing

Before creating a new artifact in an existing repository, inspect nearby
examples that were already accepted into the repo.

Use those artifacts as evidence for:

- header depth and naming style
- spacing between major sections
- callout style
- list density
- code block use
- diagram labeling conventions
- ordering of fields, steps, and concepts

When a repository has a clearly evolved local style, follow it unless
the user explicitly asks for a new style.


## Code Formatting

Follow the language formatter and local style first.

When local style does not answer a formatting question:

- order code by dependency and reading flow
- keep helper functions near the logic they support when the module is
  small
- separate reusable capability from workflow sequencing
- avoid formatting churn unrelated to the requested change


## Generated Artifacts

Generated artifacts may be both machine-readable and explanatory.

For pure interchange files, stable sorted keys may be acceptable. For
human-reviewed manifests, reports, and evidence artifacts, preserve
semantic field order when it helps the reader understand the workflow.

Do not alphabetize fields when alphabetical order hides an important
sequence.


## Artifact Naming

Related artifacts should use a consistent naming scheme when they belong
to the same stage, workflow, or output family.

When creating or reviewing artifact names, compare:

- scope prefix
- stage or workflow identifier
- artifact type
- derivation order
- compatibility constraints

If names in the same family mix patterns, prefer one convention unless
the repository already documents why the difference exists.

## Diagrams

For diagrams, preserve conceptual flow over visual novelty.

Prefer:

- left-to-right or top-to-bottom ordering that matches execution order
- clear boundaries between source, derived, validation, and manifest
  layers
- labels that match repository terminology
- grouping that reveals responsibility boundaries

Avoid diagram layouts that look balanced but imply the wrong order,
ownership, or dependency relationship.
